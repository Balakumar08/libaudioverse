#Libaudioverse Object Reference#

This page is an overview of all Libaudioverse objects.
The following tables completely describe all implemented Libaudioverse objects in terms of the C API.

For binding-specific references, see the bindings themselves.
Python uses docstrings, for example.
Also see the Binding-specific Notes section of this documentation.

Usually, the names of objects can be inferred by mentally stripping the `Lav_OBJTYPE_` prefix from the identifying enumerant and looking for `suffix_object` or `SuffixObject` depending on the conventions of your language.
These transformations are done for you in this document, listed as Camelcase Identifier and underscore identifier, respectively.

For a discussion of property types, see Property Types.  For a discussion of callbacksk see Callbacks.  This document is focused only on the objects themselves.
