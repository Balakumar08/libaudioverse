camlorn_audio2
==============

The new Camlorn_audio, implementing all the stuff the old one can't by outright abandoning OpenAL.  Note that Camlorn_audio2 is a working title, and that it will shortly be renamed.

For the moment, this code is nonfunctional; I will update this readme with actual info when it is.  This repository will shortly hold an actual library, but for the moment merely contains experimental code in no particular organization and is, most importantly, not using a build system.
