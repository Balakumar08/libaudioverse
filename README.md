Libaudioverse
==============

The new Camlorn_audio, implementing all the stuff the old one can't by outright abandoning OpenAL.  Planned features include sample-perfect callbacks on some objects, analyzers, microphone, reverb, and filters with an arbetrary frequency spectrum, but not necessarily in that order.
