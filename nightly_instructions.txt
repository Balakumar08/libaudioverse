This is a Libaudioverse nightly.  This file is regenerated every evening at midnight EST.  Libaudioverse is currently licensed under the GPL.  Please see license.txt for details.

Libaudioverse is a work in progress.  Things may break horribly for you.  Or not, who knows.  The API is stable, and major compatibility problems should not be expected at this time (but this is not a promise, should issues come up).  Minor renaming is expected to occur in future.

To use Libaudioverse in Python, install the provided wheel.  For all programming languages, you must include libaudioverse.dll and libsndfile-1.dll with your app.  C/C++ headers are in the include directory, and libaudioverse_manual.html provides what currently exists of the documentation.

Visual studio users may link directly to the provided import library; this library was built with Visual Studio 2015, but should work with earlier versions.  MinGW users can pass the DLL directly to the linker, which should link it fine.
